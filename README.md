# Winston
### Winston is an educational GPS data analysis tool (and asynchronous message passer) for Android

One half of a project intended to illuminate the ways that the large amount of data we generate each day might be used, this Android app which collects and analyzes data from a user's mobile device. The other half is a visualisation web service (using d3.js) which will help to facilitate an intuitive understanding of this continuous and complex flow of data.  Winston's architecture is trustless - all data is processed and fully encrypted client-side and is accessible only to the user themselves.

Many of our data-privacy choices are currently being *made for us*, and often not in service of our interests and long-term well-being. Winston aims to help individuals gain a more intuitive understanding of their digital footprint, and empower them to make more informed choices about its proliferation.
