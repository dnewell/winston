#Winston
Winston is a GPS data logger and asynchronous message passer for Android.

It makes up one half of a project to collect and visualize the increasingly large amount of data that an individual in generates each day. By facilitating an intuitive understanding of this continuous and complex flow of data, a person might be empowered to make informed choices about their digital footprint and its proliferation. For some, it may illuminate the fact that there are indeed choices to be made, most of which are currently *made for them*, and often not in ways that serve their interests and well-being.
