#Winston
Winston is a GPS data logger and asynchronous message passer for Android.

It is one half of a project intended to illuminate the ways that the large amount of data tmost individuals devices generate each day might be used. This half of the project is an app which collects the data from a user's mobile device. The other half is a visualisation web service (powered by d3.js) which will help to facilitate an intuitive understanding of this continuous and complex flow of data.

My hope is that through this project, an individual might be empowered to make a more informed choice about the proliferation of their digital footprint. Perhaps to help inform a person that there are indeed choices to be made, most of which are currently *made for them*, and sometimes not in ways that serve their interests and well-being.
